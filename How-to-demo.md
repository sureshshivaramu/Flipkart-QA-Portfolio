# How-to-demo (60-90s)

1. Open README.md and read the one-line summary (5s).  
2. Open Test-Plan/TestPlan_Flipkart.md — explain scope and entry/exit criteria (15-20s).  
3. Open Test-Cases/Flipkart_Test_Cases.xlsx — show 1-2 detailed test cases (20-30s).  
4. Open Bug-Reports/BUG_001_AddToCart_Fails.md and screenshots/annotated_add_to_cart.png (15-20s).  
5. Optionally run Automation/selenium_login_search.py to demo the happy path (remaining time).

Tip: Keep your narration focused: problem → your action → result/learning.
